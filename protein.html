        <h1>Protein</h1>
        <p>
          Protein is an essential 
          macronutrient that plays a
          crucial role in building
          and repairing tissues,
          making enzymes and hormones, 
          and supporting overall health.
          It is made up of amino acids, 
          which are the building blocks of proteins.
          There are 20 different amino acids,
          <strong>nine of which are considered
          essential because the body 
          cannot produce them and must obtain
          them from food.</strong>
        </p>

        <section class="food-list">

              <h2>Amino acids</h2>
              <p class="description">
                In many products, we can find lots of protein, but
                the most important thing is to know how many amino acids
                are in the product.
                Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, and they
                help with muscle growth, repair, and overall health.
                <br>Let's take an example:
                nuts are high in protein, sometimes reaching up
                to 30 grams of protein per 100 grams.
                <br>BUT many meat products also have lots
                of protein, almost 30 grams of protein per 100 grams (depending on the product).
                The good thing is that meat has all the amino acids
                that our body needs, while nuts have only some of them.
                <br>Understanding this, meat products will give you more
                amino acids than nuts, therefore there will be better muscle 
                growth and repair.
                <br>This doesn't mean that nuts are bad, they still have lots of other nutrients,
                and the amino acids that they provide are still good for your body.

              <h2>Antinutrients</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Antinutrients are naturally occurring compounds
                found in many plant-based foods that
                can interfere with the absorption of nutrients.
                While they are not harmful in small amounts,
                consuming large quantities of antinutrients can
                lead to nutrient deficiencies over time.
                Examples of antinutrients include phytates, 
                oxalates, and lectins, which can bind to
                minerals
                like calcium, iron, and zinc, making
                them less available for absorption.<br>
                <strong>Same goes for protein,</strong> to explain
                it simply, antinutrients can bind to protein
                and make it less available for absorption.
                <strong>How to stop Antinutrients?</strong> To stop
                antinutrients, you can soak, sprout, ferment, or cook and heat
                the food. These methods are typically for lentils, beans, nuts, etc.
                <br>For example, soaking beans and lentils 
                before cooking can help
                reduce
                the levels of 
                antinutrients, 
                making the protein more bioavailable.

              <h2>Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)</h2>
              <p class="description">
                The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)
                is a method used to evaluate the quality of a protein based
                on its amino acid composition and digestibility. It is
                considered the gold standard for assessing protein quality.
                The PDCAAS score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest
                possible score. A score of 1 indicates that the protein
                contains all the essential amino acids in the right proportions
                and is highly digestible. 
                <br>Animal-based proteins, such as meat, eggs, and dairy,
                typically have higher PDCAAS scores compared to plant-based
                proteins like beans, lentils, and nuts. This is because animal
                proteins generally contain all the essential amino acids in
                sufficient quantities and are more easily digested by the body.
                <br>However, it is important to note that consuming a variety
                of plant-based proteins can help ensure that you get all the
                essential amino acids your body needs, so make sure to eat 
                a variety of protein sources to meet your nutritional needs.

              <h2>Digestive and Gut Health Issues</h2>
              <p class="description">
                When you eat protein it directly goes 
                to your stomach, where the digestion process starts.
                But if you have any digestive or gut health issues,
                it can affect how well your body digests and absorbs protein.
                <br>For example, if you have conditions 
                like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
                Crohn's disease, or celiac disease,
                your gut may not function properly,
                therefore the protein digestion and absorption
                can be compromised, leading to
                nutrient deficiencies and other health problems.
                <br>There's also something called
                <strong>Enzyme Insufficiency.</strong> Here,
                your body doesn't produce enough digestive enzymes,
                which are necessary for breaking down food,
                including protein. This can lead to
                malabsorption of nutrients and digestive discomfort.
                <br><strong>Intestinal Damage or Malabsorption Syndromes</strong> are
                other issues that can affect protein digestion and absorption.
                These conditions can damage the lining of the intestines,
                making it harder for your body to absorb nutrients from food.
                Keep in mind that the small intestine is where 
                amino acids are absorbed.
                <br><strong>Disruptions to the Gut Microbiome</strong> can also
                affect protein digestion and absorption. The gut microbiome
                is made up of trillions of bacteria and other microorganisms,
                but if there's an imbalance in the gut microbiome,
                it can lead to digestive issues and nutrient deficiencies.
              </p>

              <h2>Genetic and Metabolic Disorders</h2>
              <p class="description">
                There are some cases
                where people have a metabolic or genetic 
                disorder.
                <br><strong>Amino Acid Transport Disorders:</strong> Some
                genetic conditions, such as Lysinuric Protein Intolerance (LPI),
                affect the proteins that transport specific amino acids from
                the intestines into the bloodstream and from the kidneys
                back into the body. This can lead to a deficiency
                of these amino acids in the body.
                <br><strong>Urea Cycle Disorders</strong> are a group of
                genetic disorders that affect the body's ability 
                to process and remove waste nitrogen from protein
                metabolism. This can lead to a buildup of ammonia,
                which is toxic.
                <br>However, <strong>these disorders are rare,</strong> so 
                there's no need to worry about them.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Age-Related Factors</h2>
              <p class="description">
                As we age, our body's ability to digest and absorb
                protein may decline. This can be due to a variety of factors,
                including changes in digestive enzyme production, anabolic resistance,
                and changes in gut health (digestion).
                <br>Also, <strong>older adults may also have a reduced appetite,</strong>
                which can lead to lower protein intake and
                potentially contribute to muscle loss and other health issues.

              <h2>Insufficient Calorie Intake</h2>
              <p class="description">
                If you're not eating enough calories overall, your
                body may turn protein into energy instead
                of using it for muscle growth and repair.
                <br>This is because when your body is in 
                a calorie deficit, it will prioritize using
                protein for energy rather than for other functions.
                However, if you're on a calorie deficit, and if you 
                eat enough protein, your body will still use
                some of that protein for muscle growth and repair.
                Also, your body will use fat for energy.
                <br>So make sure to eat enough calories overall, with enough protein.
              </p>

              <h2>Stress</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Chronic stress can affect your body's ability 
                to digest and absorb protein properly.
                <br>When you're stressed, your body releases
                hormones like cortisol, which can interfere with 
                muscle growth and repair.
                <br>Also, stress can affect your gut health,
                leading to digestive issues that can
                impact protein absorption.
                <br>So make sure to manage your stress levels
                through relaxation techniques, good sleep, and good exercise.
