        <h1>Good Protein Sources</h1>

        <p>
          Recently started going to the gym? Great! But just going to the gym
          won't give you gains. You need a lot of protein for your body to
          actually grow.
          <strong
            >You need about 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body
            weight per day to make progress.</strong
          >
          So, here are some food recommendations rich in protein.

                Lean beef is a fantastic source of protein, iron, and B vitamins.
                It's great for muscle growth and repair.sometimes lean beef  provides b12 vitamin
                 over 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100g, not only that, it also provides huge amounts of 
                 zinc (often provides over 50% of the DV).

                <h2>Pork Tenderloin</h2>
                <p class="description">
                  Pork tenderloin is a lean 
                  cut of pork that's low in fat and
                  high in protein. It's a 
                  great alternative to beef if you're
                  looking for something different. 
                  It's also very tender and
                  cooks quickly, not only that it contains 
                  Lots of vitamin b1, vitamin b3(niacin), 
                  vitamin b6, Zinc and etc.

              <h2>Chicken Breast</h2>
              <p class="description">
                This is a classic for a reason! Chicken breast is lean, meaning
                it's packed with protein without a lot of extra fat. It's also
                super versatile – you can grill it, bake it, shred it for
                tacos, or toss it in a salad. It's like a blank canvas for
                flavor.
                <br /><strong
                  >&bull; Per 100g of Chicken Breast contains 31g of

              <h2>Turkey Breast</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Turkey breast is an excellent protein source, very similar to
                chicken breast in its lean profile and versatility. It's often
                chosen as a healthier alternative to red meat due to its lower
                saturated fat content.
                <br /><strong

            <li>
              <h2>Eggs</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Eggs are incredibly nutrient-dense, providing all nine essential
                amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Plus, they're
                quick to cook – scrambled, boiled, fried, omelets... you name
                it. Great for any meal, not just breakfast!

            <li>
              <h2>Greek Yogurt</h2>
              <p class="description">
                If you haven't tried Greek yogurt, you're missing out. It's a
                strained yogurt, which makes it much thicker and gives it way
                more protein than regular yogurt. It's fantastic with some
                berries and a drizzle of honey.
                <br /><strong
                  >&bull; 100g of Plain Greek Yogurt contains 9.7g of

              <h2>Buckwheat</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Buckwheat is a gluten-free grain-like seed that's high in
                protein and fiber. It's a great alternative to rice or pasta and
                can be used in salads, porridge, or even pancakes.
                <br /><strong
                  >&bull; Per 100g of Cooked Buckwheat contains 3.4g of

              <h2>Milk</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Milk is a great source of protein, calcium, and other essential
                nutrients. It's perfect for smoothies, cereal, or just a glass
                on its own. If you're lactose intolerant, there are lactose-free
                options available.
                <br /><strong
                  >&bull; Per 100g of Whole Milk contains 3.4g of

              <h2>Fish (Salmon, Tuna)</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Let's divide Fish into two categories:<br />
                Salmon is not only delicious but also packed with omega-3 fatty
                acids, which are great for heart health. Tuna is another
                fantastic option, especially if you're looking for something
                quick and easy. Both are rich in protein and can be grilled,
                baked, or even eaten raw in sushi.
                <br /><strong

                Often considered a grain, quinoa is actually a seed that's
                unique among plant foods because it's a complete protein,
                meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids your body
                can't produce on its own.

                ranging from 13 to 15 grams of protein. Keep in mind that you
                wouldn't consume it raw; it expands considerably when cooked.
