        <h1>Good Protein Sources</h1>

        <p>
          Recently started going to the gym? Great! But just going to the gym
          won't give you gains. You need a lot of protein for your body to
          actually grow.
          <strong
            >You need about 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body
            weight per day to make progress.</strong
          >
          So, here are some food recommendations rich in protein.

                  cut of pork that's low in fat and
                  high in protein. It's a

                  looking for something different. 
                  It's also very tender and

              <h2>Chicken Breast</h2>
              <p class="description">
                This is a classic for a reason! Chicken breast is lean, meaning
                it's packed with protein without a lot of extra fat. It's also
                super versatile – you can grill it, bake it, shred it for
                tacos, or toss it in a salad. It's like a blank canvas for
                flavor.

              <h2>Turkey Breast</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Turkey breast is an excellent protein source, very similar to
                chicken breast in its lean profile and versatility. It's often
                chosen as a healthier alternative to red meat due to its lower
                saturated fat content.
                <br /><strong

              <h2>Eggs</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Eggs are incredibly nutrient-dense, providing all nine essential
                amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Plus, they're
                quick to cook – scrambled, boiled, fried, omelets... you name
                it. Great for any meal, not just breakfast!

              <h2>Greek Yogurt</h2>
              <p class="description">
                If you haven't tried Greek yogurt, you're missing out. It's a
                strained yogurt, which makes it much thicker and gives it way
                more protein than regular yogurt. It's fantastic with some
                berries and a drizzle of honey.
                <br /><strong

                protein and fiber. It's a great alternative to rice or pasta and

                Milk is a great source of protein, calcium, and other essential
                nutrients. It's perfect for smoothies, cereal, or just a glass

                Salmon is not only delicious but also packed with omega-3 fatty
                acids, which are great for heart health. Tuna is another
                fantastic option, especially if you're looking for something
                quick and easy. Both are rich in protein and can be grilled,
                baked, or even eaten raw in sushi.

              <p class="description">
                Often considered a grain, quinoa is actually a seed that's
                unique among plant foods because it's a complete protein,
                meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids your body
                can't produce on its own.
                <br /><strong
                  >&bull; Cooked Quinoa (per 100g):</strong
                >
                You can expect approximately 4.4 to 5.8 grams of protein. The
                most commonly cited figure is around 4.4 grams.<br />

                  >&bull; Raw/Uncooked Quinoa (per 100g):</strong

                Raw quinoa has a significantly higher protein content, typically
                ranging from 13 to 15 grams of protein. Keep in mind that you
                wouldn't consume it raw; it expands considerably when cooked.

                Tofu and tempeh are both excellent plant-based protein sources
                derived from soybeans, but they differ significantly in their

                Tempeh, a fermented soybean product, has a firmer texture and a
                nutty, earthy flavor. The fermentation process makes its
                nutrients, including protein, more digestible. It's a versatile
                ingredient for vegan and vegetarian dishes, often used in
                stir-fries, sandwiches, or as a meat substitute.
